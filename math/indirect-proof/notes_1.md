# IMLPICATIONS
-> is a statement of the form

 if \textbf{P} is true, then \textbf{Q} is true

exs:

- Math : if \textit{n} is an even integer, then $\textit{n}^2$ 
is an even integer
- Set Theory : if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A = B$.
- Queen Bey : If you like it, then you should put a ring on it

For any x, if P(x) is true, then Q(x) is true 

Means that anytime you find an object x where P(x) is true, you will see
that Q(x) is also true (for that same x).

NO CAUSATION HERE, it simply means that if you find that P(x) is true,
you will find that Q(x) is also true.

# NEGATIONS
-> is a statement that is either true or false.

The negation of the \textbf{\textit(universal}} statement 

a.\textbf{Every P is a Q}.


b. \textbf{For all x, P(x) is true}.

The negation of the \textbf{existential} statement


c. \textbf{There exists a P that is a Q}


is the existenttial statement 

a.\textbf{THere is a P that is not a Q}.


b. \textbf{There exists an x where P(x) is false}.

is the universal statement.


c. \textbf{Every P is not a Q}


# PUPPY LOGIC

## ->
The negation of the statement

“For any x, if P(x) is true,
then Q(x) is true”

is the statement

“There is at least one x where
P(x) is true and Q(x) is false.”

The negation of an implication
is not an implication!

## ->
The negation of the statement

“If your March Madness bracket is perfect,
then you get an A in CS103.”

is the statement

“Your March Madness bracket is perfect,
and you still didn’t get an A in CS103."

The negation of an implication
is not an implication!
